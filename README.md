# Qoory Skills

Give AI agents a reusable crypto intelligence workflow backed by Qoory's Remote MCP server and Developer API. Qoory is One Data Plane for crypto research, with 42 typed operations spanning entities, markets, narratives, news, funding, and signals.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add qoory-ai/qoory-skills --skill qoory
```

The installer supports Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cline, and other agents that implement the Skills format.

## What It Does

The Qoory Skill helps an agent:

- discover and resolve crypto projects, funds, people, tokens, stocks, and X accounts;
- research funding, relationships, narratives, events, news, TVL, tokenomics, unlocks, and market signals;
- choose the smallest useful set of Qoory tools for a question;
- keep facts, Qoory-derived signals, and agent inference distinct;
- avoid bulk enumeration, uncontrolled retries, and credential exposure.

## Runtime

The Skill uses Qoory Remote MCP at `https://api.qoory.ai/mcp` and can fall back to the REST API when needed. Authentication, credits, rate limits, and access controls are enforced by Qoory's hosted service; this repository contains no credentials or application source.

See [Qoory documentation](https://docs.qoory.ai/developers/skills) for setup details, authentication, credits, and request limits.

## Package

The installable Skill is under [`skills/qoory`](skills/qoory). Its references describe the supported tools, request bounds, credit costs, and failure handling.
